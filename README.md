Bastion is a simple yet effective way to build a "web of trust" for Discord servers.

## What is Bastion?

Bastion keeps track of who invited who by storing a list of "invited by" relationships. This is done by disabling Discord's default invite link functionality and replacing it with a custom invite link that Bastion generates. Bastion then stores the relationship between the inviter and invitee.

## Why use Bastion?

If you run servers that are high trust and require vouching for new members, Bastion can help you keep track of who invited who.

## How do I use Bastion?

Bastion, by design, is self-hosted only. It's easy and free to run using Cloudflare Workers.
